Each retail store records the unit sales, dollar sales, and discounts for the durable consumer products.\nThe sales are analyzed by product, scenario (actual versus budget), region, measures (units, dollar sales, and discounts), and week. This example identifies a five-dimensional model. The dimensions identify how the data is organized or how the types of data are tracked.\nIn TM1, the sales analysis can reside in one or more multidimensional structures called cubes. A collection of cubes forms a database. Each data point in a cube is identified by one element in each dimension of the cube. For example, actual dollar sales of dryers during the second week of January in the Boston store. TM1 cubes must contain no less than two and no more than 256 dimensions."

In previous releases, Cognos BI reports returned error cells as a result of default aggregation that is applied to Cognos TM1 rule-calculated cells. With ruleaware aggregation in place, the aggregation numbers are reported based on the semantics of the Cognos TM1 rules.\nThe following limitations are still in place when you compute default aggregation against rule-calculated cells:"

TM1 supports three types of elements.\nNumeric, Description = Identify the lowest-level detail in a dimension. In a cube that contains only numbers, TM1 defines all the lowest-level elements as numeric.. Consolidated, Description = Aggregations of lower-level detail. For example, you could use the 1Quarter element in a time dimension to sum the sales amounts for the first three months of the year.. String, Description = Stores text strings in cells. To include a string in a cell in a cube, the element from the last dimension defining the cell must be a string element. TM1 treats string elements that occur in any dimension other than the last one as numeric elements. The typical use for string elements is in a two-dimensional cube that converts codes in an input file to formal element names. For example, if you want to convert account codes to account names."

If you create one element per car and another dimension with elements for each color, you can use TM1 to track car sales by color. If you combine sales into a single model, you might lose valuable detail.\nConsider another example. In the car models table, there is an attribute category for engine configuration. Each car has a single engine configuration, such as V-8. If any sedans are available in more than one engine configuration, consider creating one element per engine configuration."

For example,\n```\nSELECT { [Products].[ByPriceRange].[PriceRange1] } ON ROWS, { [Measures].[Target] } ON COLUMNS FROM [Cube]\n```\ndisplays the total Target from the PriceRange1 products. We can refine the total by including an extra hierarchy in the query.

The order you select can affect system performance, so you should give some consideration to the order of dimensions before creating a cube.\nAs a first step toward ordering dimensions, divide the dimensions into two groups: sparse and dense dimensions. A dense dimension has a high percentage of values for its elements. You can estimate the density by answering this question: If one element in the dimension has a value, keeping the elements of the other dimensions constant, what is the probability that the other elements in the dimension have values?\nFor example, if you have a budget in January for a given account and region, you probably also have a value for the remaining months. Therefore, the Month dimension is probably dense. Similarly, if you have a budget value for a given month, account, and region, you probably also have an actual value, making ActVsBud a dense dimension.\nHowever, in a worldwide sales cube, you probably do not sell every product in every region.
