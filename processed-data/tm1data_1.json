Each retail store records the unit sales, dollar sales, and discounts for the durable consumer products.\nThe sales are analyzed by product, scenario (actual versus budget), region, measures (units, dollar sales, and discounts), and week. This example identifies a five-dimensional model. The dimensions identify how the data is organized or how the types of data are tracked.\nIn TM1, the sales analysis can reside in one or more multidimensional structures called cubes. A collection of cubes forms a database. Each data point in a cube is identified by one element in each dimension of the cube. For example, actual dollar sales of dryers during the second week of January in the Boston store. TM1 cubes must contain no less than two and no more than 256 dimensions."

For example, you can convert the local currency amounts to a reporting currency by using a two-dimensional cube that stores the exchange rates. You retrieve the rate using the TM1 rule.\nThe number of dimensions in a cube depends mostly on the dimensionality of your data.

Each category corresponds to an aggregation of detail for two or more elements in a dimension. For example, you can create quarterly elements that sum monthly sales amounts. In TM1, elements that represent aggregations are called consolidated elements or consolidations.\nThe following diagram shows three levels of consolidation for elements of a Region dimension.

In some cases, \"repeating groups\" can occur. For example, a ProductCategory dimension includes Product1 in its Commercial category and Product2 in its Retail category. When a value is addressed by Product1, the ProductCategory coordinate is always Commercial. If the product category is a true attribute, then these \"repeating groups\" are not necessary since a product will never exist in both Commercial and Retail categories.\nAlternatively, a multi-hierarchical approach can be used where a Product dimension includes a ByCategory hierarchy, including other hierarchies such as ByPriceRange or ByRegion. This method reduces the number of dimensions in the cube. Added complexity comes with the need to specify the hierarchy that an element pertains to; whether in querying, or in TI or cube rules."

A dense dimension has a high percentage of values for its elements. You can estimate the density by answering this question: If one element in the dimension has a value, keeping the elements of the other dimensions constant, what is the probability that the other elements in the dimension have values?\nFor example, if you have a budget in January for a given account and region, you probably also have a value for the remaining months. Therefore, the Month dimension is probably dense. Similarly, if you have a budget value for a given month, account, and region, you probably also have an actual value, making ActVsBud a dense dimension.\nHowever, in a worldwide sales cube, you probably do not sell every product in every region.

To address these issues, TM1 includes a feature that lets you optimize the order of dimensions in a cube, thereby consuming less memory and improving performance.\nWhen you optimize the order of dimensions in a cube, TM1 does not change the actual order of dimensions in the cube structure. TM1 does change the way dimensions are ordered internally on the server, but because the cube structure is not changed, any rules, functions, or applications referencing the cube remain valid.\nAs you change the order of dimensions, you can instantly view a report detailing the impact your changes have on cube memory consumption.\nFor the following reasons, you should optimize the order of dimensions in a cube only in a development environment while you are trying to determine optimal cube configuration:"

With cube rules, you can create formulas to perform these calculations.\nWith cube rules, you can perform the following tasks:\n- Multiply prices by units to yield the sales amounts.\n- Override consolidations when necessary. For example, you can prevent a quarterly price from displaying a tally of individual monthly prices.\n- Use data in one cube to perform calculations in another cube, or share data between cubes. For example, you can pull sales data into a cube that contains Profit and Loss information.\n- Assign the same values to multiple cells.\nNote: You must be a member of the ADMIN group to create or edit TM1 rules."

The statement ['Total']=ConsolidateChildren('Month') performs this calculation.\nHowever, there remains an implicit inconsistency when viewing the cube: the sum of the quarterly totals for each product is different from the sum of product total for each month.

Only the reference is deleted.\n- Deleting a source object in TM1, or a file on disk, breaks any corresponding reference in an application, but does not delete the reference. The reference remains but is not functional if the source object or file is deleted.\nOne exception to the above is for uploaded file references.

Therefore, when you have ADMIN access to an application, you can delete sub-applications and references to which you were assigned only the READ or NONE privilege.\nTo illustrate the ADMIN privilege for deleting an application, consider the following example. There are three applications on a server (App1, App2, and App3), all created by a member of the ADMIN group.\nThe administrator has defined the following security privileges to the applications for the North America user group:\nApp1, Security Privilege for North America User Group = Admin.
