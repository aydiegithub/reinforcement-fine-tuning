  {
    "question": "Explain the difference between mechanical and chemical digestion, providing examples of each.",
    "answer": "Mechanical digestion involves physically breaking down food into smaller pieces, increasing the surface area for chemical digestion. Examples include chewing in the mouth, churning in the stomach, and segmentation in the small intestine. Conversely, chemical digestion involves using enzymes and acids to chemically break down food molecules into their constituent parts. For example, pepsin in the stomach breaks down proteins, while amylase in the mouth breaks down carbohydrates."
